        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Endowing machines with knowledge has long been
regarded as one of the important goals of AI. Traditionally, symbols and their relations represent knowledge for natural language processing. Large
language models (LLMs) follow the tradition of connectionism and neural networks employing distributional numerical vectors/matrices to represent
knowledge. This way, almost all knowledge types can be represented and embodied into a unified semantic space. A cutting-edge research direction
of neural computing is to move from associative thinking (System I) to rational thinking (System II). This may demand traditional deep learning to  
go beyond the statistical learning framework, and make qualitative extensions to represent and reason with explicit knowledge. A variety of new
learning biases has been proposed to narrow the gap between higher-level cognition and traditional deep-learning. It is an open question how neural
networks can reach deterministic rational reasoning at the level of symbolic AI. To sum up: the state-of-the-art in deep learning for NLP and beyond shows
that there are many open research questions to be addressed at the interface of symbolic and neural approaches and that bridging neurons and symbols
may break the glass ceiling of deep learning for NLP.</p>
