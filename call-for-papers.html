    <h2> Note </h2>
    <p> When submitting a paper from the START page, please provide essential information about resources (in a broad sense, i.e. also technologies,
standards, evaluation kits, etc.) that have been used for the work described in the paper or are a new result of your research. Moreover, ELRA encourages
all LREC-COLING authors to share the described LRs (data, tools, services, etc.) to enable their reuse and replicability of experiments (including
evaluation ones). </p>
